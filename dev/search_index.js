The discrete signal is interpolated as a piecewise linear function and the transform is evaluated at points along the imaginary axis, im * ωs.\n\nThe Mellin transform is strongly influenced by the behaviour of the function close to the origin. This can present a challenge when the Mellin transform is used for scale-invariant signal analysis as this weighting can obscure other variations further from the origin. To remedy this issue Zwicke et al. (1983) proposed a modified Mellin transform s F(s) where F(s) is the Mellin transform of the original signal.\n\nArguments\n\nsignal : values of discrete signal on a uniform grid (including the origin)\nωs : Mellin-space frequencies to evaluate on imaginary axis\nstep : spacing of discrete signal (default 1)\nmodified : compute the modified Mellin transform as defined in [1]\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Zwicke, P.
